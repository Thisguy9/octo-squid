# octo-squid
An AOL-type chat app.
This is a silly thing I basically took off of a code site. Almost no change, if none. I may have modified the code a while ago, but I'm not sure at all.
If someone could, please help me fix this I am too dumb to know how to fix it. Also someone please help fix my light cycles project. (The one w/ no readme.)
Thanks!
